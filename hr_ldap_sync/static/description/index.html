    <p>
      This module allows the user to create a mapping between Odoo Models and
      an LDAP Directory Information Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following that mapping it allows the user to synchronize the information
      between the two platforms. It also features the ability to update the
      Foreign Keys between the different models.
